# Students-Sleep-Social-Media-Behavior-SSSMB

This project investigates how behavioral and demographic factors influence student sleep duration in the context of social media use. Using a dataset of over 700 global participants, we applied stepwise selection, interaction modeling, and Weighted Least Squares (WLS) regression in JMP to identify key predictors of reduced sleep.

Core variables include average daily social media use, addiction scores, mental health ratings, and interpersonal conflict measures, with additional categorical factors such as academic level, relationship status, and region.

The final model achieved an R² of 0.90, effectively correcting heteroscedasticity and highlighting strong interactions between mental health, addiction, and social conflict.

Key analyses and visuals include:

Stepwise model selection and effect tests

Weighted least squares model diagnostics

Residual and influence plots

Regional clustering for cross-cultural behavioral similarities

Validation via training/test partition and model fit assessment

This repository contains the JMP output files, regression summaries, and visualizations used for the final report and presentation in STAT 311 – Regression Analysis.
